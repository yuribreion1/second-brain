# About

The topics will be organized under three main topics:

- Technology
- Productivity
- Philosophy and thinking

## Technology

Information technology and information security subjects will be presented under this category, and specific products would be mentioned as GitHub, Azure, and other technologies related to the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

## Productivity

The word productivity was for a long time associated with a false capacity to perform many things, and as the time passes, more and more I am learning and realizing that it is more related to acting smartly. I will drop contents in that regard here.

## Philosophy and thinking

Self-development requires a lot of thinking, and philosophy is a great area of interest that improves that process. The idea is to provide insights and collections of thoughts from several philosophers and experts on this topic.
