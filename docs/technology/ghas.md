## GitHub Advance Security

Refers to understanding how to use the security features of GitHub to secure your code from security vulnerabilities. Three services are found under the Security tab:

- Dependabot
    - Open-source vulnerabilities
    - Scan dependencies and raise alerts
    - Take action from GitHub on vulnerabilities
- Secret Scanning
    - Secrets stored/passed in repositories
    - Scan secrets and raise alerts
    - Take action from GitHub
- Code Scanning
    - Scan for code vulnerabilities
    - Scan and raise alerts on vulnerabilities
    - Use GitHub Actions workflow and CodeQL

GHAS is integrated within GitHub and can check for:

- Secrets in code
- Vulnerability in login of the code
- And vulnerable open-source libraries being used by the code

## Enable GHAS

You can enable GHAS in four ways:

1. Personal/individual
    1. Account settings > Code security and analysis
2. Organization
    1. Organization > Settings > Security > Secrets and variables
3. Repository level
    1. Settings > Security
4. Pro or Enterprise plan level

## Security Vulnerability

Potential risk to an organization that can be exploited by a malicious attacker to misuse or negatively impact the organization

- Web-based security vulnerabilities as XSS, CSRF, SSRF
- Open-source vulnerabilities
- Stored secrets
- Cloud misconfiguration
- Zero day
- Virus, malware, ransomware
