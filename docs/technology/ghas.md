## GitHub Advance Security

Refers to understanding how to use the security features of GitHub to secure your code from security vulnerabilities. Three services are found under the Security tab:

### Dependabot

- Identifies **security vulnerabilities in open-source libraries**
- Scan dependencies and raise alerts
- Take action from GitHub on vulnerabilities

### Secret Scanning

- Follow an access token to simulate the Secret Scanning functionality:

```bash
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

- Secrets stored in **repositories** like passwords, access tokens, etc.
- Scan secrets and raise alerts
- Take action from GitHub

Full list **of current secret patterns** supported by Secret Scanning - [Link](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns#supported-secrets)

#### Push Protection

- Scans for secrets in **every commit** that is pushed into repository with secret scanning enabled.
- Prevents secrets from appearing into the repository in the first place.

#### Continuous Scan

- Detect and alert on any **existent secrets** in the repository with secret scanning enabled.
- Helps to detect secrets that are already in the repository. It **does not prevent any new secrets from being added**.

#### Secret Scanning Partner Program

GitHub Partner Program enables product companies to partner with GitHub to be notified if any of their secrets are being leaked on a public or internal GitHub repository. Partners provide **regular expression** via a verification endpoint to detect possible secrets. Follow some of the partners available:

- NPM
- Canva
- Postman
- Terraform
- Atlassian

### Code Scanning

- Identifies **security vulnerabilities in the code**
- Scan and raise alerts on vulnerabilities
- Use GitHub Actions workflow and CodeQL

GHAS is integrated within GitHub and can check for:

- Secrets in code
- Vulnerability in login of the code
- And vulnerable open-source libraries being used by the code

## Enable GHAS

You can enable GHAS in four ways:

1. Personal/individual
    1. Account settings > Code security and analysis
2. Organization
    1. Organization > Settings > Security > Secrets and variables
3. Repository level
    1. Settings > Security
4. Pro or Enterprise plan level

## Security Vulnerability

Potential risk to an organization that can be exploited by a malicious attacker to misuse or negatively impact the organization

- Web-based security vulnerabilities as XSS, CSRF, SSRF
- Open-source vulnerabilities
- Stored secrets
- Cloud misconfiguration
- Zero day
- Virus, malware, ransomware

## GitHub Advisory Database

- [Reference](https://github.com/advisories)

A database maintained by GitHub with a list of security vulnerabilities of CVE and GitHub own research.
