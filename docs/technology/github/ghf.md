# GitHub Foundations

## Introduction to Git

### What is version control?

A version control system (VCS) is a program or set of programs that tracks changes to a collection of files. With the goal to easily recall earlier versions of individual files or of the entire project.

Another name for a VCS is software configuration management (SCM). VCS is one of the practices involved in SCM.

Instances of VCS used a centralized server to store a project history. This centralization meant that the one server was also potentially a single point of failure.

**Git is distributed**, which means that a project's complete history is stored both on the client and on the server.

### Git terminology

- **Working tree**: The set of nested directories and files that contain the project that's being worked on.
- **Hash**: Git uses hashes that are 160 bits long, to identify if a file has changed or not. If the file timestamp is changed, but the file hash isn't changed, Git knowns the file contents aren't changed.
- **Object**: A Git repo contains four types of objects:
  - A blob object that contains an ordinary file.
  - A tree object represents a directory.
  - A commit object represents a specific version of the working tree.
  - A tag is a name attached to a commit.
- **Branch**: Is a named series of linked commits. The most recent commit of a branch is called the _head_.

### Git and GitHub

As mentioned previously, Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS). GitHub is a cloud platform that uses Git as its core technology, that acts as the remote repository.

### Basic Git commands

- `git status`
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git log`
- `git help`

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git, a distributed version control (DVCS) system, as its core.

### Four pillars of GitHub

- **AI**: The GitHub Enterprise platform is enhancing collaboration through AI-powered pull requests and issues through Copilot, and security by automating security checks faster.
- **Collaboration**: Repos, Issues, Pull Requests, and other tools to help the whole company to work faster, cut down approval times, and ship more quickly.
- **Productivity**: CI/CD tools directly integrated into the workflow, the platform gives users the ability to set tasks and forget them. Giving time to developers to focus on what matters most.
- **Security**: GitHub Enterprise platform includes native, first-party security features that minimize security risk with a built-in security solutions. Security Overview and Dependabot are those features.

### Introduction to repositories

#### What is a repository?

A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history.

## Knowledge checks

- Which of the following scenarios is a common use case for a version control system?
  - Making experimental changes to your project in an isolated branch.
- What is another name for a version control system?
  - Software configuration management (SCM) system
- Whatâ€™s the difference between Git and GitHub?
  - Git lets you work with one or more local branches and push changes to a remote repository. GitHub acts as the remote repository, which is accessed through a website or command-line tools.
- What Git command gives information about how to use Git?
  - `git help`

## Commands tested on the sandbox

- Initiate a git configuration setting the branch as main

```bash
git init -b main
```
